Game Name: Monster Mash

The Rundown:
Train your monster by training it then have it compete in the weekly competition against your rivals!
The game is primarily text based
Navigate the menus with arrow keys up and down and use Enter to select
During the Speed Training Minigame, use the left and right arrow keys to dodge the falling objects. The less times you get hit, the more speed your monster gets.
Currently on the Speed Training Minigame is complete, but we also intend for their to be different minigames for Strength and Stamina Training.
The competition is currently just a simple skillcheck calculated by generating an advantaged stat for the competition, calculating the highest of the stats among your 2 rivals, and giving a slight
	randomization to both your monster's stats and your rivals' stats. If you pass the skill check, you win the competition and receive a prize in the form of gold.
Gold is not used for anything currently, but will be used in the future to buy items in the shop to influence your monster's stat growths and performance during training and competitions
The demo ends on day 10.
Also, yes, there are currently no sounds for the entire game, and everything except for the village screen is lacking a background. There are also no animations for the monsters. It will come however!
We've only been working on programming the game since the final concept document was submitted, a week ago. Please don't be too harsh, but do give criticism and ideas!
